# Financial-Analysis-of-Three-Stocks

This project focuses on perfoming a financial analysis of three selected stocks using Python. The stocks that I used were AAPL, MSFT, and TSLA. The analysis is done within Jupyter Notebook, and covers various aspects of stock performance, including data collection, visualization, and statistical analysis. 

Key Features:

1) Data Collection: Stock data for three selected companies is fetched using an apropriate API, Historical data is analyzed for trends and patterns
2) Data Visualization: Visualizations are created to illustrate stock price movements, trading volumes, and other relevant finance metrics
3) Statistical Analysis: Calculation of financial key ratios such as price-to-earnings(P/E), moving averages, and other indicators. Analysis of daily returns and volatility
4) Summary and Insights: It also provides a summary of key insights derived from the analysis. Potential investment strategies based on the analysis are also discussed
